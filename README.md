# PDF Library

`PDF Library` is an efficient C# library that implements lots of functionalities on PDF files like compressing, font-embedding, cropping, merging, splitting, extracting, rotating and much more.
Because it does not need to display the PDF while performing the specified action, it is quite a lot faster then any PDF-Application like for example Adobe.
The library not only robustly handles errors but also maintains a comprehensive logging system for all operational activities.
Additionally for all operational activities, it creates a backup that can be restored later on.

## Featuresr√ºckseite

- **Compress:** Removes duplicated references of images and other resources and therefore reduces a lot of space in the PDF-filesize.
- **Font-Infos:** Retrieves all the informations from the fonts used in a PDF file including base-font, sub-type, encoding, if embedded or not, if subset or not and more.
- **Embed Fonts:** Unembedded fonts can be embedded, when there is a font in the font-database that matches the font-informations.
- **Optimize:** Tries to embed all the unembedded fonts where possible and compresses PDF file.
- **Merge:** Multiple PDF files can be merged into one PDF file.
- **Split:** PDF files can be split by a certain amount of pages.
- **Crop:** Pages can be cropped to A4 or other sizes.
- **Page-Operations:** There are lots of operations that can be performed on a page-level like removing empty pages, extract or multiply or rotate pages, insert pages, and more.
- **Restore:** Before performing an operation that will change the PDF file, a backup will be created, that can be restored later on.
